VisualML SDK Architecture
==========================

The VisualML SDK is the core of the VisualML framework. It provides the functionality to create and manage machine learning pipelines, including data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation. The SDK is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing developers to easily add new components and customize existing ones.

The SDK is organized into several modules, each of which provides a specific set of functionality. The main modules are:
