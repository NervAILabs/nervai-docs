The VisualML Design Philosophy
======================================

The VisualML project is designed to be a modular and extensible framework for creating visual machine learning pipelines. When you clone the repository, you will see that the project is divided into two main components:

- The `vml-sdk` folder contains the SDK, which defines the core functionality of the framework.
- The `vml-server` folder contains the Flask web server, which serves the GUI and acts as the middleware between the GUI and the backend.
